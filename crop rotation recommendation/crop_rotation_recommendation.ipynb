            "\n",
            "It is not recommended to plant wheat after potatoes. This is because potatoes are a heavy feeder and can deplete the soil of nutrients, which can harm the growth of wheat and other crops. Additionally, potatoes are known to harbor pests and diseases that can spread to other crops. It is recommended to plant a cover crop, such as clover or rye grass, after potatoes to help restore soil health and fertility.\n",

            "Question: How often should I rotate my crops?\n",
            "Answer: It is generally recommended to rotate crops every one to three growing seasons, depending on the crops and soil conditions. A typical rotation cycle could include legumes followed by grains, then root crops or leafy greens. However, the specific rotation schedule may vary based on the specific crops and soil conditions. It is important to consult with an agronomist or other agricultural expert to determine the best rotation schedule for your specific farm or garden.\n",
