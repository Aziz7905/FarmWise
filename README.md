## Introduction
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet it faces numerous challenges such as resource inefficiency, unpredictable weather patterns, and pest control. **FarmWise** leverages data science and machine learning to provide actionable insights that help farmers make better decisions and optimize their yields.

This project was developed collaboratively by a team of six students as part of their academic coursework at ESPRIT University in Tunisia.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing for agricultural datasets.
- Machine learning models for predicting yield, resource management, and pest detection.
- Interactive frontend for visualizing data and insights.
- Backend integration to manage data pipelines and model deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5
- **Backend**: Django  
- **Data Analysis & Modeling**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Database**: MySQL   
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
